As a software engineer, I've always been driven by the desire to solve real-world problems through technology. My latest project, EduHub, is an example of this passion in action. EduHub is a platform designed to streamline the process of connecting schools with teachers—making life easier for both.

The Problem: Finding the Right Job Shouldn’t Be So Hard

As someone who has previously looked for teaching opportunities, I know firsthand how frustrating the search can be. You have to knock on school doors, call institutions, or post inquiries on social media, hoping someone is looking for a teacher. This can feel like a job in itself!

That’s when I thought: What if there was a platform where teachers could search for open teaching positions, and schools could easily find qualified candidates? And so, EduHub was born.

The Solution: EduHub in Action

EduHub solves two major problems:

    For School Managers: It provides a platform to post job openings for teaching positions and easily find qualified candidates.

    For Teachers: It offers a centralized platform to search and apply for teaching jobs—no more cold-calling schools or scrolling endlessly through social media.

The Tech Stack

Since I was handling both the back-end and front-end, I had to choose technologies that I was comfortable with but also scalable and secure. Here’s what I settled on:

    Back-end: I used Django for its robust security features and active community. Having experience with Django, I felt confident it would serve EduHub’s needs well.

    Database: I opted for MySQL for managing user data and job postings.

    Front-end: The front-end is built using Django’s templating engine, with styling handled by crispy_bootstrap5 and crispy_forms to ensure that the platform looks modern and is mobile-friendly.

Overcoming Challenges: The User System

One of the biggest technical hurdles I faced was handling two distinct types of users—school managers and teachers. Each of these user groups needed their own unique experience on the platform, from sign-up to dashboard views.

At first, I thought about creating two separate user models, but Django’s authentication system doesn’t easily support multiple models. After some research, I discovered a better approach: using a single custom user model with two profiles—one for school managers and one for teachers. This solution streamlined the user experience while still meeting the needs of both types of users.

What I Learned: The Power of Django

This project has given me a deeper appreciation for Django. Initially, I wasn’t convinced by all the hype around the framework, but now I understand why people call it a "batteries-included" framework. It’s powerful, flexible, and made tackling this project far easier than I imagined.

Beyond Django, this project taught me a lot about software engineering in general—particularly the importance of logical thinking and patience. I now feel more confident in my ability to bring ideas to life through code.

Looking Ahead: What’s Next for EduHub?

While I’ve been working on this project solo, I’m excited about the potential to expand and involve more people in the future. EduHub is designed to be scalable, and I see a lot of opportunities to grow its features and reach. Whether that means adding more tools for schools and teachers or improving the platform's user experience, there’s a lot to look forward to.

Final Thoughts:

EduHub started as a simple idea—"What if there was a better way to connect schools and teachers?"—and has since evolved into a fully functional platform. I’m excited to continue improving it and seeing how it can make the process of finding teaching jobs easier for both schools and educators.
